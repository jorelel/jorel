                That admiration led me to pick up a ball and start practicing on my own.<sup>2</sup> I remember
                watching him dribble effortlessly, making it look so easy, yet when I tried, the ball always
                seemed to have a mind of its own.<sup>3</sup>  Still, I was determined to get better. <sup>4</sup> Every afternoon,
                I would join him on the court, trying to copy his moves. <sup>5 </sup>At first, I struggled to even make
                a simple layup, but he encouraged me to keep going.<sup>6</sup> Over time, my dribbling improved,
                and I started making more shots.<sup>7</sup>  I fell in love with the sound of the ball bouncing on the
                pavement and the swish of the net.<sup>8</sup> As I got older, I began playing in school tournaments. <sup>9</sup>
                The thrill of competition pushed me to train even harder.<sup>10</sup> I spent countless hours
                practicing my jump shots, working on my defense, and improving my footwork.<sup>11</sup> My
                brother remained my biggest supporter, offering advice after every game.<sup>12</sup> There were
                moments of frustration when I missed crucial shots or lost important games, but I never
                gave up.<sup>13</sup> Instead, those challenges fueled my passion even more.<sup>14</sup> The lessons I learned
                on the court taught me discipline, teamwork, and perseverance. Eventually, I earned a
                spot on my school’s varsity team. Wearing that jersey for the first time was a moment of
                pride, not just for me but for my brother as well.<sup>15</sup> He reminded me that basketball is more
                than just a game; it’s a way of my life. Now, every time I step onto the court, I remember
                where it all started.<sup>16</sup> The journey from watching my brother play to becoming a player
                myself has been incredible.<sup>17</sup> I still have a long way to go, but I am excited for what the
                future holds.<sup>18</sup> Basketball has shaped me into who I am today, and I am grateful for every
                moment spent playing the game I love.<sup>19</sup></p>

                Tournament, but things didn’t go as planned.<sup>2</sup> Ever since I started playing, I imagined
                myself competing at the highest level, representing my school on the big stage.<sup>3</sup> I trained
                hard every day, pushing my limits to improve my skills.<sup>4</sup> I joined tryouts with high hopes,
                determined to prove myself.<sup>5</sup> I gave my best effort, showcasing my dribbling, shooting,
                and defensive skills. However, the competition was fierce, and the coaches had tough
                decisions to make. When the final roster was announced, my name wasn’t on the list.<sup>6</sup> It
                was one of the hardest moments of my life.<sup>7</sup> I felt disappointed, frustrated, and even
                questioned if I was good enough.<sup>8</sup> I watched my friends and teammates celebrate their
                spots while I stood on the sidelines, feeling left behind.<sup>9</sup> For days, I struggled to accept
                reality, wondering what I could have done differently.<sup>10</sup> But instead of giving up, I chose
                to learn from the experience.<sup>11</sup> I realized that setbacks are part of the journey, and failure
                doesn’t mean the end.<sup>12</sup> I continued training, using my rejection as motivation to work
                even harder.<sup>13</sup> I played in smaller leagues, gaining more experience and confidence.<sup>14</sup> I
                focused on improving my weaknesses, becoming faster, stronger, and more strategic on
                the court.<sup>15</sup> My brother reminded me that even the greatest players faced failures before
                achieving success.<sup>16</sup> Though I didn’t make it to the UAAP, my love for basketball never
                faded.<sup>17</sup> I found other opportunities to play, whether in community leagues, school
                tournaments, or street games.<sup>18</sup> I learned that basketball isn’t just about playing in big
                tournaments; it’s about passion, perseverance, and self-improvement.<sup>19</sup> My dream may not
                have come true the way I imagined, but I still hold my head high.<sup>20</sup> The lessons I learned
                through this journey have made me stronger.<sup>21</sup> I know that as long as I keep playing and
                growing, new opportunities will come.<sup>22</sup> One rejection does not define my future.<sup>23</sup> I still
                believe in myself, and I know my basketball journey is far from over. <sup>24</sup> </p>

                an I.T. student. <sup>1</sup> Transitioning from my dream of playing in the UAAP to focusing on my
                studies was not easy, but I realized that life always has different paths to success. <sup>2</sup> At
                first, it was difficult to shift my mindset from basketball to academics. <sup>3</sup> I missed the
                adrenaline of the game, the sound of the ball bouncing, and the thrill of competition. <sup>4</sup>
                However, I knew that education was just as important in building a bright future. <sup>5</sup> As an
                I.T. student, I discovered a new passion for technology. <sup>6</sup> I became fascinated by coding. <sup>7</sup>
                Just like in basketball, I had to practice, learn new skills, and improve every day. <sup>8</sup> At first,
                programming felt as challenging as learning a new basketball move, but with this, I
                started to get better. <sup>9</sup> There were days when I felt overwhelmed by deadlines, projects,
                and exams. <sup>10</sup> However, I reminded myself that challenges are part of growth. <sup>11</sup> Just like on
                the court, hard work and discipline would lead me to success. <sup>12</sup> I also learned to balance
                my time, making sure I still played basketball whenever I could <sup>13</sup> The sport remained my
                escape, helping me stay focused and motivated. Whenever I felt stressed, a quick game
                with opponents or friends helped me reset my mind. <sup>14</sup> Through my college journey, I met
                professors and classmates who inspired me to push far from my limits. <sup>15</sup>Group projects
                taught me teamwork, just like basketball had, and problem-solving became my new
                game <sup>16</sup> Now, I see a bright future ahead. <sup>17</sup>I dream of becoming an I.T. professional, using
                technology to solve real-world problems. <sup>18</sup> My love for basketball will always be a part of
                me, but I have also embraced my new passion. <sup>19</sup>Looking back, I realize that setbacks in
                life often lead to new opportunities. <sup>20</sup> Not making it to UAAP was disappointing, but it
                pushed me toward another dream. <sup>21</sup> It is still sad that my first dream of becoming a good
                basketball player did not come true, but now, I will achieve success in my own way. <sup>22</sup> </p>
