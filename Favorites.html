            <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px;">This is far my most favorite RNB song of The Weekend. The moment I heard this, it makes me sing the song without even thinking.I’d rate “Timeless” around 7.5 to 8 out of 10. It’s a fun track to keep fans entertained while waiting for the full album. The beat is catchy, and The Weeknd brings a fresh vibe we haven’t heard in a while. Carti’s verse fits smoothly with the song. Jordan Terrell Carter (born September 13, 1995 or 1996),[a] known professionally as Playboi Carti, is an American rapper.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px;">The Weeknd (born February 16, 1990, Toronto, Ontario, Canada) is a Canadian rhythm-and-blues singer and songwriter best known for his explicit songs about sex and drugs, many of which are autobiographical, and for his soaring falsetto and its singular tremolo.</li>
            <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px;"> The production of “Timeless” is a standout feature, seamlessly merging elements of trap and R&B. The beat is built on syncopated rhythms and deep basslines that drive the track forward, yet maintain a reflective undertone.</li>

            <li style="font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 24px; margin: 30px;">This song is from the movie Black Panther, and it fits the film perfectly. It has a strong beat and powerful lyrics that make it really stand out. For me, it's the best outro song ever, as it leaves a lasting impact and wraps up the movie beautifully. The music adds to the film's emotions and makes the ending even more memorable. It’s easily a 9/10 and my favorite outro song so far.</li>
